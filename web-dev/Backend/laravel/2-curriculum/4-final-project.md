# Final project

You are encouraged to do the assignments and exams for each course, but what really matters is whether you can *use* your knowledge to solve a real world problem.

After you've gotten through all of Core Laravel and the parts of Advanced Laravel relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, the project will *validate* and *consolidate* your knowledge.

## Evaluation

Upon completing your final project, submit your project's information to PROJECTS via a pull request and use our community channels to announce it to your fellow students.

Your peers and mentors from the community will then informally evaluate your project. You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense — everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success. The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a developer, and to get experience listening to feedback — both positive and negative — and taking it in stride.

The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether CoderPlex, through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining knowledge.
