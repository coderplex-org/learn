- We also have a chat room! [Join the chat at [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/331374249921216514/335713856427130882)]

> **PS**: A forum is an ideal way to interact with other students as we do not lose important discussions, which usually occur in communication via chat apps.
**Please use our discord group for important discussions**.
