## Open Source Guides for Self-learners

One of the major conflicts with self-learning as a developer, is figuring out where to get started with the technology that you are interested in and then chalking out your overall learning path from that point forward. There is a lot of unnecessary trial and error that everyone goes through, which is inefficient and this something, we as developers, should try to reduce. 

The goal of these open source guides is to recommend the best online resources (video + text) to learn any and every technology out there.But that's not all, we believe that there are five stages to learning which are:Theory,Practice,Creation,Collaboration and Teaching, so our goal is to enable all of them through these guides and our offline efforts.

## Contribute a new guide
We cannot cover everything in tech alone, we need your help. You can also create a open source guide for the technology that you have experience in, and contribute it to this project. You can use the [Laravel guide](https://github.com/coderplex/learn/blob/master/web-dev/Backend/Learn-Laravel.md) as a guide for formatting and structure.
