# <p align="center">Preface</p>
The generally accepted definition of AI is the Turing test, first proposed in **1950**, as the ability of a machine communicating using natural language over a teletype to fool a person into believing it was a human.
"AGI" or "artificial general intelligence" extends this idea to require machines to do everything that humans can do, such as understand images/a scene, a robot that can be used for fire fighting, recognize and respond appropriately to facial expressions,self-drive cars and so on.

# <p align="center">Curriculum</p>

**Curriculum version**: `1.0.0`


#### Open Source Project:

## <p align="center">Final project</p>

You are encouraged to do the assignments and exams for each course, but what really matters is whether you can *use* your knowledge to solve a real world problem.

After you've gotten through all of  the parts of the curriculum relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, the project will *validate* and *consolidate* your knowledge.

## <p align="center">Evaluation</p>

Upon completing your final project, submit your project's information to [PROJECTS-(will be updated)](PROJECTS.md)
via a pull request and use our [community](#community) channels to announce it to your fellow students.

Your peers and mentors from the community will then informally evaluate your project.
You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense — everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success.
The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a developer, and to get experience listening to feedback — both positive and negative — and taking it in stride.

The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether CoderPlex,
through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining knowledge.

## <p align="center">Cooperative work</p>

You can create these project alone or with other students!
**We love cooperative work**!
Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!
