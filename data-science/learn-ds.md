Introduction to **Data Science** provides a comprehensive overview of modern data science: the practice of obtaining, exploring, modeling, and interpreting data.

#### What is [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)?
Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of **mathematics**, **statistics**, **information science**, and **computer science**, in particular from the subdomains of **machine learning**, **classification**, **cluster analysis**, **data mining**, **databases**, and **visualization**. Since, all of these topics are mentioned it is quite obvious that people might take it in wrong way, that leads to our second question i.e What is not Data Science.

#### What is not Data Science?
Since Data Science is buzz word in the media, people are compelled to assume it whatever they want to. If you ask set of people what Data Science exactly is, you might end up hearing plethora of definitions and concepts involved. Let's head to what it isn't:

- **Is is some sort of software?** :  Data Science is not a software engineering piece of work. That is, data science is not about building products or product features or systems or any related fancy things.

- **Is it way to visualise random set of data?** : Data science is not a visualization piece of work. Creating the cool visual is neither the end goal nor the beginning part of how a data scientist works. Needless to say, data science is not about creating visually impactful infographics.

- **So is it way to build cool science theories?** : Data science is not a scientific piece of work. In particular, data scientists don't work in the academia. It is the industry's particular requirements and the business markets' call that makes the job of data scientist needed. Data scientists usually don't publish papers, and neither is the paper or book publishing business part of any data scientists' daily concerns
.

- **So is it a synonym for Business Intelligence?** : **Business Intelligence** basically analyzes the previous data to find hindsight and insight to describe the business trends. BI enables you to take data from external and internal sources, prepare it, run queries on it and create dashboards to answer the questions like quarterly revenue analysis or business problems. BI can evaluate the impact of certain events in the near future.
**Data Science** is a more forward-looking approach, an exploratory way with the focus on analyzing the past or current data and predicting the future outcomes with the aim of making informed decisions. It answers the open-ended questions as to “what” and “how” events occur.

#### Why do we need Data Science?
 - Traditionally, the data that we had was mostly structured and small in size, which could be analyzed by using the simple BI tools. Unlike data in the traditional systems which was mostly structured, today most of the data is unstructured or semi-structured. Let’s have a look at the data trends in the image given below which shows that by 2020, more than 80 % of the data will be unstructured.
This data is generated from different sources like financial logs, text files, multimedia forms, sensors, and instruments. Simple BI tools are not capable of processing this huge volume and variety of data. This is why we need more complex and advanced analytical tools and algorithms for processing, analyzing and drawing meaningful insights out of it.

Drawing insight from a piece of data involves understanding how it fits into the larger picture of an organization, explains IBM’s Jeff Jonas, distinguished engineer and chief scientist for IBM Entity Analytics. Business environments aren’t the only ones that require context; context is a necessity for any attempt to know more by examining data.
